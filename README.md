# Rainbow Restoration
 
This is a game made in a week for the first GeoJam hosted by the youtuber Icoso with the theme of "The Other Side." Also the whole concept of the geojam is to use geometric shapes such as squares triangles and circles.

My submission was Rainbow Restoration, a puzzle platformer. In the game you have to collect the seven color orbs and make it to the rainbow to beat the level of which there are seven. However collecting an orb with create walls and platformers of the same color, so you have to strategize which order to get the orbs.
